Assignment for an Information Theory course

Implementation of software that enables user to input an arbitrary number of codewords of a binary block code _K_ of arbitrary size and for the input determines and prints following:

 1) Codeword length _n_ and message length _k_.
 2) Is code _K_ linear?
 3) Standard array of code _K_.
 4) Probability of correct decoding of codeword.

The software can also decode arbitrary codeword and print decision-making summary for the decoding.

The software is still being developed so it may not have all the listed features implemented.
